Water Viewer 2

CPPS Project by Yee Hao

Project Specification

a.Brief Description
To use average water consumption by household type in Singapore in 2014 data to derive and display:
1. Average water consumption of HDB households for selected household across 12 months.
2. Water consumption of a selected household for a selected month.
3. Differences between average water consumption and water consumption of each household type for a selected month.
4. Display quarterly total(Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, and Oct-Dec) water consumption of a selected HDB household.
5. Display the lowest water consumption and its corresponding months and household type from Jan to Dec.
6. Find the difference in water consumptions of HDB 5-room in each consecutive month. Display the highest increase amount and its corresponding month (eg. Jan-Feb,Feb_mar etc).

b.Scope of Project

Type of input data
-Average water consumption of each household, stored as float
-User menu choice (a,b,c,d,e,f) stored as character
-Total water consumption of HDB households in 12 months stored as float
-User's choice of month and household stored as integer
-Quarterly total of water consumption of selected HDb household stored as float
-Difference in average water consumption stored as float

Amount of input data
-12 months across 5 types of HDB rooms
-6 choices in the main menu
